# ECSE3038-LAB5

The previous 2 labs allowed the student to design a functional RESTful API server, so the tasks left are to design a user friendly GUI for the tank storage application. This frontend app should be used to allow a user to interface with the kind of data that the backend server is mean to handle. The app should provide a user with a simple form that accepts the various attributes of of a tank object. This form should come with a button that allows a POST request to the server and the frontend should make a GET request to a server and dynamically add cards (with tank data) to the screen.

The design of the frontend is up to the user. A title should be added at the top of the page and the HTML, CSS and JS files should be separate.
